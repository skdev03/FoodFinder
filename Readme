I used MVVM with Coordinator and RxSwift. It's been a while I used RxSwift, so it took me a little longer than I expected to get the work done within 4 hours. As a result, I was not able to work on the Unit tests.

I organized all the classes in their respective folders.

Views:
SearchViewController
BusinessCell

Model:
Business (contains the data parsed from the JSON)

ViewModel:
SearchViewModel

The SearchViewModel model triggers a call to the get the new results for the API when the user starts typing a search term. When it gets the results back, it updates the observable which is used to bind to the tableView in SearchViewController. Used custom image caching mechanism for the images.

If I had more time, I would have liked to clean up the search functionality and made it more efficient. I would have also liked to implement a detail view when tapped on a result. I would also have worked on the unit tests. Currently the search are reverting back when we tap on the Cancel button on the search bar. I would have fixed it.
